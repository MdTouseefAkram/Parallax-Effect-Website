                My eyes peeled open slowly and the bright sunlight flooded into my eyes, blinding me. I heard the sound of running water and felt the cold breeze flow over my body. I looked out of my hammock and in front of me was a beautiful waterfall and several towering, bright green trees. My friends whom were with me shortly awoke and we packed our things and set off on our first true day of hiking in the Appalachian mountains.
            <br> <br>
            Deep in the Alps lies a small town called Clay. The sun was rising over a frosty blue mountain, and drops of dew dripped down from the leaves in the valley. Arthur awoke to find his bedroom filled with light. He went downstairs and drank a glass of water, not hungry enough for food. Arthur went outside into the chilly morning and started walking down the road. The road was lined with hundreds of huge alpine trees. A large flock of birds flew over Arthur’s head in the sky.

                Cycling is not only a fun and healthy activity, but it can also be a great way to explore nature. One of my most memorable experiences was a bicycle ride to a forest. It was a sunny day with a cool breeze, and I could not resist the urge to take my bike for a spin.As I rode through the streets and suburbs, I could feel the excitement building up inside me. It was a perfect day for a ride, and I was eager to reach my destination. After about an hour of cycling, I finally arrived at the entrance to the forest.
            <br> <br>
            The first thing I noticed was the silence. The hum of cars and the noise of people disappeared, replaced by the rustling of leaves and the chirping of birds. I took a deep breath and felt the fresh, crisp air fill my lungs. The sight that greeted me was breathtaking. A lush, green forest with tall trees and a clear, babbling brook running through it lay ahead of me.I parked my bike and took a walk along the dirt path. I was amazed at how peaceful and tranquil the forest was. The light filtering through the trees created a serene ambiance, and I felt all my worries and stress melt away. I heard the crunching of leaves beneath my feet as I walked, and the sweet scent of pine filled my nostrils.
